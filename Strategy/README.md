# Strategy Design Pattern / Strateji Tasarım Şablonu
## Intent
 - Define algoritm family and encapsulate each one
 - Using this pattern you can use strategies interchangeably
 - It is also called Policy Pattern

## Example
One good example of that is sorting for strategy pattern suppose 
you have an integer array and you want to sort that array.
I implement two different sort algoritm insertion and bubble sort. 
By using this pattern you can add new algoritms easily with out changing any code from context.
